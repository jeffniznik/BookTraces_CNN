# BookTraces_CNN
R code for training a prototype CNN model on page images to detect handwriting. The BookTraces_Pagework file contains code for how to prepare image folders and add new data, but it does not include anything about the neural net. The BookTracesCNN file has this code. The parallel file is the version of the CNN adapted to run on the rivanna cluster on multiple GPUs.
